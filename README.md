# Context
I didn't know what I wanted to study until my Senior year of High School.  I took an AP Computer Science 
class around Java principles and coding, and I fell in love.  This project was the culmination of what I 
learnt that year, an ode to what I found, but in project form.  It wasn't the prettiest project, but it
was my first.

For why put it here, the project is currently stored on Eclipse, and that IDE scares me, so I'm trying to 
bring over what I've made so I don't accidentally lose it.

# "Why?"
Some common questions I was berated with through the making of this project:
> "Why would you word it like that?"

> "You can't just make a game like a dirty love letter for a friend"

> "What did he[^1] do to deserve being in this creation?"

> "What's a KingMan?"

> "That's disgusting."

Simply put, I did it because I could.  And because I wanted to.  And because the project was for a grade, 
so I had to turn something in for the class final.  

**But really, I did it because it was fun.**

Thank you.
